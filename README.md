# Todolist Practice

This project is a practice to build up a todo list with Node.js, and the tutorial is from http://dreamerslab.com/blog/tw/write-a-todo-list-with-express-and-mongodb/ .


## Dependency

* Node.js
  * Development Environment: 4.2.6
* Mongo DB
  * Development Environment: 2.6.10

## Change

* API
  * Change API with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE to complete CRUD.
* Front-end
  * Use bootstrap and apply jQuery AJAX call for accessing REST API resources.


## Note

* How to run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

* After the server is up, you can access it via http://<SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>:3000/
* There is no default account by default, you can create accounts by yourself.
